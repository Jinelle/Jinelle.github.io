    </h5>

    <p>
        
        From Kenya's vibrant capital, we descend into Kenya's Great Rift Valley to Lake Nakuru National Park. The best known of a string of lakes lying along the valley floor, Lake Nakuru is world renowned for its birdlife, especially flamingos, which are attracted by the lake's shallow alkaline waters. Although small (by African standards), Nakuru National Park contains rhinoceros, buffalo, leopards, baboons, lions, antelopes and giraffes. We enter the park after lunch and spend the afternoon game driving. Finally,we leave the park for an overnight stay at a nearby hotel.

        DAY 2: Lake Naivasha, Nairobi
        
    </h5>

    <p>
        
        Leaving Nakuru, we drive along the Rift Valley to the freshwater Lake Naivasha, a major centre for flower growing and horticulture. We drive to 'Crescent Island' nature reserve (on the lake shore) to see antelope, giraffes, zebras and prolific birdlife on foot. Wander around this very pleasant reserve at leisure. Seeing wild animals at ground level is a very rewarding experience, but look out for hippos (not as cute as they look!). We have lunch in Naivasha before returning to Nairobi, where the tour ends.

    <h5>
    
    DAY 1: Kampala, Bwindi Impenetrable Forest
        
    </h5>
    

    <p>
        
        From Kampala, it is a full day's drive through beautiful countryside to the rainforests of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Heading south, we climb into the Kigezi Highlands, past terraced hillsides dotted with traditional settlements, and arrive at our camp on the edge of Bwindi Forest in the late afternoon.
        
    </p>
    

    <h5>
        
        DAY 2: Bwindi National Park, Gorilla Trek
        
    </h5>
    

    <p>
        
        Bwindi is a magnificent green swathe of ancient rainforest and an area of unrivalled biodiversity. In the early morning, we embark on our gorilla trek, entering the tangled and mist-shrouded forests, accompanied by experienced guides and trackers. We may scramble over mossy rocks and through deep undergrowth on our search through the rainforest, but the effort is more than worth it. Watching these amazing animals in their natural habitat is an unforgettable experience. After an hour with the gorillas, we return to our camp for a relaxing afternoon.

        DAY 3: Kampala

    <p>
    
        Departing in the early morning, we drive back to Kampala, stopping for lunch en route. We expect to arrive back in Kampala in the early evening after our short but exhilarating experience in the African jungle.
